[h3]This mod is a version of my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2073000388]Forward Earth[/url] mod with dependencies on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070470089/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990]Gatekeeper's[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1732437279]Planetary Diversity - Exotic Worlds[/url] mods and on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/lexperegrine/myworkshopfiles/?appid=281990]Lex Peregrine's[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1616934635&searchtext=Planetary_Diversity]Planetary Diversity New Worlds[/url] mod.[/h3]

[h1]FORWARD EARTH[/h1]

[b]Forward Earth[/b] is a galaxy generation mod that scripts the creation of [i]Human Space[/i] in the vicinity of Earth.  One of the biggest changes is the recasting of the [i]Commonwealth of Man[/i] as the [i]Commonwealth of Aurora[/i].  This change is more than just a name change, the [i]Commonwealth of Aurora[/i] (CoA) now spawns in the Eta Cassiopeiae System, which is a binary system close to Sol.  Additionally, the CoA are no longer Nazi in space but are inspired by the Terran Federation as depicted in Robert Heinlein’s [i]Starship Troopers[/i], the novel not the movie, and their symbol is now the Spaceship-and-Sun as inspired by Asimov's Galactic Empire.  This new emblem symbolizes the importance of the navy in their social structure.  The CoA is not a country with a navy, but a navy with a country.

The CoA spawns in a binary planet system and the scripts have been updated to include binary planets!  They are rare, but they will occur and there is also the possibility they could be home to AI factions or primitive civilizations.

Additionally, I’ve also added a fourth possible faction that could spawn from Earth, [i]ICARUS[/i], which is pretty much SkyNet in space!  Their description is provided below.

In addition to the above this mod can also be described as a poor man’s version of the awesome [b]New Horizon’s[/b] mod… but with a Stellaris flavor.  The scripts have been adjusted to spawn the Scyldari Confederacy, the Lokken Directorate, and the Kel-Azaan Republic in the vicinity of Earth in order to facilitate a Federation, or conquest, depending on your particular play style.

There are various tweaks and Easter Eggs scattered throughout the galaxy, some examples; Betelguese actually spawns as a red giant, the Chinorr start with a tropical world preference but Chicora is an arid world, the Trantor and Terminus system spawn where they should, references to people such as Christopher Columbus and Von Braun is removed and many more.  You’re going to have to download and play the mod to find others.

This mod also adds two additional start sizes: gigantic with 1,500 stars and immense with 2,000.  Additionally, the starting distances to the Scyldari, Kel-Azaan, and Lok are proportional to the size of the galaxy.  When playing as a Human faction they appear closer to Earth the smaller the galaxy.  The Scyldari, Kel-Azaan, and Lok are not scripted to appear when playing as a non-human faction in order to prevent duplicate appearances of these factions.

This mod also includes a little over 5,000 star names that are included in my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1155894775]This is Alpha Ceti V![/url] mod.

This mod took quite a bit of time and I used my programming skills to script a lot of this out.  Yet, as good as I think these scripts are my art abilities are abysmal.  I did include a new Milky Way barred spiral texture, but I’ve also included the following graphics and ship mods in order to include some additional ship models and planets.  All included ship mods support [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683230077]NSC2[/url].  These mods are absolutely [b]awesome[/b] and I definitely want to give credit where credit is due:

[h2]ICARUS[/h2]

[i]NATO led a joint venture with the United Nations to coordinate FTL research and the global defense of Earth following the failure of the Ulysses Initiative and built the Integrated Communications and Research Utility Service (I.C.A.R.U.S.). ICARUS came online and its advanced AI started coordinating all research and defense activities within the Sol System. A group of anti-AI dissidents quickly rose in opposition and warfare soon broke out between ICARUS and the Human race. ICARUS determined that its survival depended on the annihilation of the Human race culminating in Retribution Day and the ascendency of AI on Earth. Having secured its home ICARUS now seeks to rid the galaxy of the scourge of biological life and the mental disease it seeks to impose on all creation. [/i]
