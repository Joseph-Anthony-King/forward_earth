[h1]FORWARD EARTH[/h1]

Like most people playing this game I love science fiction and this mod is a galaxy generation mod that presets the game in ways I like to play.  [b]Forward Earth[/b] sets up a sort of human space where a few early space human factions start near each other.

A new government type is added: Planetary Union.  The planetary union is oligarchic in nature and is kind of like the neo-liberal order in space.

There a few changes to the human factions.  The [b]United Nations of Earth[/b] is now an oligarchic planetary union that starts with civics efficient bureaucracy and diplomatic corps.  The [b]United Federation of Earth[/b] is a democratic anarcho-syndicalist union that of course starts on Earth with civics beacon of liberty and idealistic foundation.  The [b]Commonweatlh of Man[/b] is now the [b]Commonwealth of Aurora[/b] which is a citizen stratocracy that starts on [i]Eta Cassiopeiae[/i] within the vicinity of [i]Sol[/i].  Rather than being a dictatorship it is more of a citizen republic with civics of meritocracy and citizen service.  There is also an NPC Human faction which will generally appear, the [b]League of Human Colonies[/b].  Their origin is similar to the [b]Commonwealth of Aurora[/b] except they arrived at a desert world.  They are only recently unified into an oligarchic authority with ethics of authoritarianism and fanatic materialists and civics of cuttthroat politics and warrior culture.  Altogether, they form a kind of human space which makes for some interesting early game play.

Additionally, there is a new AI Earth faction I.C.A.R.U.S. which is pretty much [i]Skynet[/i] in space.  The description is as follows:

"NATO led a joint venture with the United Nations to coordinate FTL research and the global defense of Earth following the failure of the Ulysses Initiative and built the Integrated Communications and Research Utility Service (I.C.A.R.U.S.). ICARUS came online and its advanced AI started coordinating all research and defense activities within the Sol System. A group of anti-AI dissidents quickly rose in opposition and warfare soon broke out between ICARUS and the Human race. ICARUS determined that its survival depended on the annihilation of the Human race culminating in Retribution Day and the ascendency of AI on Earth. Having secured its home ICARUS now seeks to rid the galaxy of the scourge of biological life and the mental disease it seeks to impose on all creation."

This mod also adds two additional start sizes: gigantic with 1,500 stars and immense with 2,000. This mod also includes the star names included in my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1155894775]This is Alpha Ceti V![/url] mod. This mod includes a little over 5,000 names. I used a number of franchises, the Greek alphabet, Egyptian, Sumerian and Hindi mythology and an online name generator to generate the list (sorry but I forgot to get the link).

This mod took quite a bit of time and I used my programming skills to script a lot of this out.  Yet, as good as I think these scripts are my art abilities are abysmal.  I did include a new Milky Way barred spiral texture, but I’ve also included the following graphics and ship mods in order to include some additional ship models and planets.  All included ship mods support [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683230077]NSC2[/url].  These mods are absolutely **awesome** and I definitely want to give credit where credit is due:
