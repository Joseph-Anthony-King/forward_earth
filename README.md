### Please note this is an update of a prior mod I had uploaded to steam.  That mod is no longer available for new subscriptions though it has been updated to Stellaris version 2.6.*.  This prior mod will not receive future updates and if you wish to get the latest updates you will need to subscribe to this mod.

# FORWARD EARTH

**Forward Earth** is a galaxy generation mod that scripts the creation of *Human Space* in the vicinity of Earth.  One of the biggest changes is the recasting of the *Commonwealth of Man* as the *Commonwealth of Aurora*.  This change is more than just a name change, the *Commonwealth of Aurora* (CoA) now spawns in the Eta Cassiopeiae System, which is a binary system close to Sol.  Additionally, the CoA are no longer Nazi in space but are inspired by the Terran Federation as depicted in Robert Heinlein’s *Starship Troopers*, the novel not the movie.  

Additionally, I’ve also added a fourth possible faction that could spawn from Earth, *ICARUS*, which is pretty much SkyNet in space!  Their description is provided below.

In addition to the above this mod can also be described as a poor man’s version of the awesome **New Horizon’s** mod… but with a Stellaris flavor.  The scripts have been adjusted to spawn the Scyldari Confederacy, the Lokken Directorate, and the Kel-Azaan Republic in the vicinity of Earth in order to facilitate a Federation, or conquest, depending on your particular play style.

There are various Easter Eggs scattered throughout the galaxy, as an example Betelguese actually spawns as a red giant.  You’re going to have to download and play the mod to find others.

Even though this is an human centric mod the scripts have been adjusted to be responsive to the set up screen.  As an example, say you set the the number of AI players to 1 and no guaranteed colonizable worlds, then the Scyldari Confederacy, Lokken Directorate, and Kel-Azaan Republic will not spawn, there will be no colonizable worlds in your immediate vicinity, and there will only be one AI player somewhere out there in the void.  This holds even if you play as a non-human player.  Additionally, I did test this out and suppose you want to play as a Roman inspired earth, then you can simply edit the United Nations of Earth faction and you will assume their seat.  The CoA will still spawn but you can then play in the place of the United Nations.

*…but wait!  There’s more!*  The CoA spawns in a binary planet system and the scripts have been updated to include binary planets!  They are rare, but they will occur and there is also the possibility they could be home to AI factions or primitive civilizations.

This mod also includes the star names included in my **This is Alpha Ceti V!** mod. This mod includes a little over 5,000 names. I used a number of franchises, the Greek alphabet, Egyptian, Sumerian and Hindi mythology and an online name generator to generate the list (sorry but I forgot to get the link). Below is a random sampling:

- Alkaid
- Athyr
- Baobab
- Ceti Alpha (of course)
- Dagda
- Dastamon
- Dressel
- Felis
- Fentrul
- HD 153095
- HIP 418058
- Hydra Centauri
- Hydra Iota
- Lambda Alpha
- Lambda Nu
- Matjar
- Monea
- Rayhadya
- Sanopel
- Stronad
- Theta Upsilon

This mod took quite a bit of time and I used my programming skills to script a lot of this out.  Yet, as good as I think these scripts are my art abilities are abysmal.  I did include a new Milky Way barred spiral texture, but I’ve also included the following graphics mod in order to include some additional ship models and planets.  These mods are absolutely **awesome** and I definitely want to give credit where credit is due:

Dwaine's Immersive Galaxy mod adds a nice touch, but this mod also requires the following:

This mod supports Portuguese, French, German, Polish, Russian and Spanish, please let me know if you notice any issues with the translations and I will correct them.

Hope everyone enjoys it and please let me know if you note any bugs or issues!

## ICARUS

*NATO led a joint venture with the United Nations to coordinate FTL research and the global defense of Earth following the failure of the Ulysses Initiative and built the Integrated Communications and Research Utility System (I.C.A.R.U.S.). ICARUS came online and its advanced AI started coordinating all research and defense activities within the Sol System. A group of anti-AI dissidents quickly rose in opposition and warfare soon broke out between ICARUS and the Human race. ICARUS determined that its survival depended on the annihilation of the Human race culminating in Retribution Day and the ascendency of AI on Earth. Having secured its home ICARUS now seeks to rid the galaxy of the scourge of biological life and the mental disease it seeks to impose on all creation. *
