I really love the base version of Stellaris but I wanted to implement a few simple tweaks in order to improve the immersive experience of the game, especially as it relates to Earth factions. This mod implements these tweaks.

The Commonwealth of Man has been renamed to the Commonwealth of Aurora and its starting system has been moved to Eta Cassiopeiae. Deneb is currently estimated to be about 2,600 light years from Earth which would put it outside the range established by the Human space feature; as such I've moved their starting system to Eta Cassiopeiae. They now start on Aurora which is a binary planet system located in Eta Cassiopeiae, the second planet being Tithonus. The Deneb system will still spawn, but it will be an uncolonized system ripe for the taking!

The default government type for the Commonwealth has been changed to a Citizen Stratocracy, I thought it was a better example of a frontier government founded by hardy settlers. The ethics were changed to "civic meritocracy" and "civic citizen service" (think of the Terran Federation as depicted by Robert Heinlein in “Starship Troopers”). Additionally, the Aurorans only settled their new homeworld with one Ark ship a century prior to the start of the game. As such the League starts with simple robots to the work the mines (much like the Spacers in Isaac Asimov's Robot stories) and a smaller population, the ethics for the Commonwealth have also been changed to ethic_fanatic_materialist and ethic_militarist to enable robots.

One major feature of this mod is my implementation of the "Human Space" feature; this mod uses the framework as implemented in my "Human Space! Part Deux" mod!

This feature works as follows:

If you play as the United Nations of Earth there is a weighted possibility that the Commonwealth of Aurora will spawn in your vicinity. There is also a lesser possibility that the Eta Cassiopeiae system will spawn as an empty system within your vicinity.

If you play as the Commonwealth of Aurora there is a weighted possibility that the United Nations of Earth will spawn in your vicinity. There are also two lesser possibilities that Earth will spawn as an early space age empire or that Earth will be a nuclear wasteland.

I also created a new Earth based faction know as I.C.A.R.U.S., their description is as follows:

NATO led a joint venture with the United Nations to coordinate FTL research and the global defense of Earth following the failure of the Ulysses Initiative and built the Integrated Communications and Research Utility System (I.C.A.R.U.S). I.C.A.R.U.S. came online and its advanced AI started coordinating all research and defense activities within the Sol System. A group of anti-AI dissidents quickly rose in opposition and warfare soon broke out between I.C.A.R.U.S. and the Human race. I.C.A.R.U.S. determined that its survival depended on the annihilation of the Human race culminating in Retribution Day and the ascendency of AI on Earth. Having secured its home I.C.A.R.U.S. now seeks to rid the galaxy of the scourge of biological life and the mental disease it seeks to impose on all creation.

Playing as the Earth Custodianship or as I.C.A.R.U.S. generates the same possibilities as playing as the United Nations of Earth.

If you play as a non-human civilization there is a possibility humans will spawn as a primitive civilization or as the United Nations of Earth.

This mod also includes the star names included in my "This is Alpha Ceti V!" mod. This mod includes a little over 5,000 names. I used a number of franchises, the Greek alphabet, Egyptian, Sumerian and Hindi mythology and an online name generator to generate the list (sorry but I forgot to get the link). Below is a random sampling:

Alkaid
Athyr
Baobab
Ceti Alpha (of course)
Dagda
Dastamon
Dressel
Felis
Fentrul
HD 153095
HIP 418058
Hydra Centauri
Hydra Iota
Lambda Alpha
Lambda Nu
Matjar
Monea
Rayhadya
Sanopel
Stronad
Theta Upsilon

I've also created a new galaxy texture that creates a default barred spiral galaxy, even when playing in an elipitical galaxy, this more closely resembles the current measurements of the Milky Way.

In order resolve any possible conflicts I have included the following mods, I want to give a shout out to all the work our modding community has done! The following mods were included:

Dwaine's Immersive Galaxy mod adds a nice touch but this mod also requires the following:

This mod uses the galaxy sizes from Sol Unleashed: 800, 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000. Thanks for the work ositodefelpa!
