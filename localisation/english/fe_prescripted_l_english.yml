 EMPIRE_DESIGN_icarus_desc:0 "NATO led a joint venture with the United Nations to coordinate FTL research and the global defense of Earth following the failure of the Ulysses Initiative and built the Integrated Communications and Research Utility Service (I.C.A.R.U.S.). ICARUS came online and its advanced AI started coordinating all research and defense activities within the Sol System. A group of anti-AI dissidents quickly rose in opposition and warfare soon broke out between ICARUS and the Human race. ICARUS determined that its survival depended on the annihilation of the Human race culminating in Retribution Day and the ascendency of AI on Earth. Having secured its home ICARUS now seeks to rid the galaxy of the scourge of biological life and the mental disease it seeks to impose on all creation."
